There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > An interactive map for A ski Resort called...

## Sub-Heading ##
  > The market for this product is for anybody on the mountain.  Most likely not people who are super familiar with the mountain.  However, for the majority of customers who would enjoy an interactive guide to what the resort has to offer.

## Summary ##
  > This app will allow you to visualize the mountain in an interactive way and show you what the mountain has to offer.  You will be able to see all of the chairlifts and trails.  This includes the difficultly of all the trails.  Furthermore, one will be able to see the features that are not relating to skiing.  Such as an upcoming event section, places to eat, the ice rink, etc...

## Problem and Solution ##
  > Convenience of an interactive map.  Instead of pulling out that obnoxious and hard to read map that the hill provides.  You will have a simple, colorful and clear guide to what the resort offers you for that day.  The average person coming to the resort does not want to read a complicated map.  They will want something simple and easy to understand.  They will want to meet up with others easy and my app will accomplish this task.

## Quote from You ##
  > What is this a Ski Hill for ants?!!
