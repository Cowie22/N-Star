# N-Star

> Full stack interactive Ski-Resort-Map application.  

> This project was a two day sprint to see what we could create in such a time frame.  Overall I'm very happy and impressed with the result given this constraint.  I will be updating this project in the future to make it function much better and usable for phones.  I believe that this application will benefit many people and it has real potential.
